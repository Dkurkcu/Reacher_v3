The main goal is to create an environment which the reacher and the target positions reset upon succes or failiure.
So far, the succesful version of the project contains randomized reacher starting points and fixed target positions.I could not managed to create randomized target positions aswell.
The other problem would be the system does not recognize the "ball" as a solid object which causes the reacher fingertip to only reach for the "target" value of the ball therefore causing phasing.
I have prepared a word document that includes step by step process and reward / step graphs.
